Soon the man decided to marry again. His new wife was not kind like the first, but proud and cruel. She also had two daughters, who were just like her. She did not like her new daughter at all, who was much kinder and prettier than herself and her daughters. So the poor girl was given the dirtiest work in the house. She had to scrub dishes and floors. She was made to clean out the fireplaces. She was treated like a slave. Her sisters had fine rooms to sleep in, with lovely, soft beds. But she only had a small, cold room in the attic, and her bed was made of straw."

key_phrase_2 = "Professor Hallberg-Smith teaches a hybrid course in econometrics. Instead of using an expensive textbook, she posts course content in Brightspace that she herself wrote. During class sessions students work in groups to solve and review problem sets, and she takes questions about the readings and the problems. Hallberg-Smith has not had time to create her own problem sets for the course; instead she uses problems from the textbook Introduction to Econometrics written by James H. Stock. Aware of the high cost of this book, Professor Hallberg-Smith does not want students to have to buy it just for the problem sets, so she scans the problems to PDF and posts them in Brightspace for students to download and use. Is this fair use?"
